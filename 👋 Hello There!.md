My name is Arnar and welcome to my [[Digital Garden]].

This is my personal website where I will attempt to drop notes about things I'm exploring and I'm interested in. This website used to be a blog but I didn't publish anything very often, I hope with [[Digital Garden]]ing the bar is lowered enough for me to publish more often. If you'd like to access posts from my [[old blog]] they're still here.

If you'd like to get in touch with me your best bet would be [email](mailto:codedbearder@codedbearder.com).

This [[Digital Garden]] is generated using [[Oblish]], a static site generator I wrote especially for this purpose.

The best way to get started is to follow one of the links below and see where it takes you ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I have plans to improve navigation in [[Oblish]] by having a search function and a graph view similar to [[Obsidian]].
