There used to be a blog here but I didn't publish anything very often. In an attempt to lower the bar of publishing I have turned this website into a [[Digital Garden]].

### My previous blog posts are however still up
- [[I wrote a keyboard remapper for wayland]]
- [[Running NixOS on a consumer NAS]]
- [[TX3 Mini - Mainline Linux on an Android TV Box]]
